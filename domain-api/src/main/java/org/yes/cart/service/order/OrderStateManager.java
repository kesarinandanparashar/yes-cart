/**
 * Order state manager performs transition between order and delivery states.
 * <p/>
 * Each transition is performed as action to even. The actions are performed by event handlers
 * {@link OrderEventHandler}.
 * <p/>
 * Each event has before and after listeners.
 * <p/>
 * Success flow for event is:<p/>
 * 1. before listener onEvent<p/>
 * 2. event handler handle<p/>
 * 3. after listener onEvent<p/>
 * <p/>
 * Note: before step 3 OrderEvent.getRuntimeParams() are updated with "handled" Boolean and optionally
 * "handledException" OrderException if one occurred.<p/>
 * <p/>
 * Default implementation contain comprehensive event flow that copes with various situations.
 * If different flow is required then one should consider remapping handlers for events and implementing
 * own handlers that alter the flow as necessary.<p/>
